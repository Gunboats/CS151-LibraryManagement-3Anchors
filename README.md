## Members working on Project Code:
* Willy: Managed github post-proposal creation. Created most exceptions for AddRemoveBookException, AddRemoveUserException, BorrowBook, SignUpException, LoginException. Worked on Library, User, Book. Contributed to EnterInformationFrame, LibraryLoginSignUpFrame, LibraryCatalogMenu, EnterLoginAdminFrame, EnterSignUpFrame, LibraryUserMenu, EnterBookFrame, Enter InformationFrame, LibraryBorrowedBooksMenu, the README.md inside the src folder with test cases you manually have to enter. Implemented exception handling, made most of the GUI's JFrames, popups, Bonus's user view and admin view. 
* Alex: Managed github during project proposal phase, transferred control to Willy after. Initialized project files in github. Added to basic Library operations during the early stages of the project and created some testing for the library, pre-GUI, in the Pre-commit-to-main-branch branch. Implemented import and export functionality on Test-branch-file-writing, and created a format for storing Library data in a JSON file along with some test libraries.
* Yelin: Contributed to Libray.java, User.java, LibrayLoginSignUpFrame.java(These were pushed the laurindaaa-patch branch. But it was overrided by the team's code and didn't merge into the final branch). Added the password format checker. Fixed the import path for library.json. Updated the libray.json data inclduing books data and user data. Updated README.md.

## Members working on Project Report: Alex, Willy, Yelin
### Problem to solve: 
* We have a library that lacks a digital system for users to use and store important data such as the books in their catalog and the users that are registered with the library. We want to create a library management system that manages a library’s digital catalog of books and users with their respective information such as borrowed books, their name, and their library card number. This library management system should have a GUI that is intuitive and not difficult to use. Libraries and users need to be able to login to use their respective privileges. This requires us to uniquely identify each user to each library.

### Assumptions / Operating Environments / Intended Usage: Assumptions: 
* The project of a Library management system will run on Java and the interactable user interface will be implemented using Java Swing to create a GUI. Users will be able to interact with the library, being able to use functions like borrow books, return books. Libraries can manage users and books in their system, adding and removing them. Both libraries and users should be able to interact with the GUI by performing actions like clicking on buttons. The library will have the ability to save and load stored data.

### Functionality
* The project will store the data of a library in a file to keep track of books, users, and update if there are any changes to it.
* Data can be loaded, providing access to a library, their users, and their books.
* Users will be able to borrow books, check borrowed books, and look through the library’s catalog (without being able to modify it directly except through checking out or returning).
* Libraries can manage their users and books by removing and adding them.
* The system will have functions to manage user’s borrowing fees.
* There will be a login system with different levels of access for libraries and users.
### Operations
#### Admin operations:
* Import: Imports a library file's data to the GUI, which will allow the admin to use that data of books and users for removing, adding. The admin may choose what file to be imported, and only valid files work
* Export: Exports the library's data to a file, and the admin may choose where to place the file. It will create the file with a name based on the library's name
* Add user: Admins may add users to the library, but they must fill out the sign up fields of the user's first name, last name, phone number(must be unused with library), and their password
* Remove user: Select a user for removel, and removes a user from the library on pressing the remove button, and reopens the library's list of users to reflect that the selected user was removed
* Add book: Adds a book to the library, admins must fill out the book form, which requires a title and author, which will update the list of books in the library. Changes made will update the library.json file
* Remove book: Removes a book from the library if it is not already borrowed (we still want the book back for tracking before removing from catalog), changes made will update the library.json file
* Logout: Admins may logout of the GUI, returning them to the main menu (LibraryLoginSignUpFrame)
* Exit: Admins can exit the program, which will save the changes made to the library to the library.json file
* Login: Admins can login, requiring them to enter the proper username and password combination to access the next JFrame: The list of users in the library
#### User operations
* Sign up: Users can sign up, filling out their first name and last name with valid characters, unused phone number with library, a password with specific requirements for password strength
* Login: Users can login to the library, which checks for correct password and username combination: Prevents users from logging in if they enter incorrect information, and successful login allows the user to view the library's list of books for borrowing
* Borrow: Users may select checkboxes of books they wish to borrow, and upon pressing the borrow button, it will add the books to the user's list of borrowed books, updating that the books are borrowed. Borrowing fails when the user has already borrowed a copy of the book with exact casing and same title and author. Borrowing also fails when user tries to borrow 2 copies of the same book. Changes made will update the library.json file
* Books Borrowed: Displays the books the user has borrowed
* Return books: In the JFrame displaying the books the user has borrowed, the books borrowed can be returned by the user. By selecting the checkboxes of books and pressing the return book button, it will make the books available again at the library, and take out the books from the user's list of borrowed books. Changes made will be saved to the library
* Logout: Users may logout of the GUI, returning them to the main menu (LibraryLoginSignUpFrame)
* Exit: Exits the GUI, shutting down the components and saving the changes made to thel ibrary
### Solution
* We have created a GUI that uses a library.json file to store the contents of a library. Inside are the library's books, users, user's borrowed books
* Admins can login in the Admin login section, allowing them to select check boxes to choose what users to remove, what books to remove.
* Admins may additional create and add new books and users by filling out the JFrame's form, which will update the JFrame that displays all the users or books
* Admins may additionally import a library and export the data of the library
* Users can register and login to the library, which will open the Library's catalog of book
* Users can select checkboxes to choose what books to borrowed, though they cannot borrow books they already have borrowed or the books are already borrwoed
* Users may only borrow books available at the library
* Users can click the books borrowed button to see what books they have borrowed, and return books. Users cannot return if they have selected no books

### Steps to Run Code
* Before running the code, make sure you have set up the environment, for example: Make sure you have set up the necessary development environment, including the required programming language (JAVA).
* Download the zip file, take out the folder in side (CS151-LibraryManagement-3Anchors file)
* Add the contents of the CS151-LibraryManagement-3Anchors file into a new project
* The src folder's content's should go into the src folder of the new project, and the other files should be outside of the source folder
* Here is how the Package Explorer should look:
* ![image](https://github.com/Gunboats/CS151-LibraryManagement-3Anchors/assets/30137980/d20fa74f-0997-4606-9918-62852ed1f0bc)
* We see bin, diagrams, lib, and proposal are not in the src folder, etc but next to it

  
### Steps to Run JAR
* Clone the project repository to your local computer.
* Assuming you have download the Zip file, take the CS151-LibraryManagement-3Anchors file out of the zip or extract the file outside of the zip
* Run the JAR from inside the CS151-LibraryManagement-3Anchors file (not the compressed folder) that you took out 
* It should say "TestLib" on the main menu when you run it, not "a"
